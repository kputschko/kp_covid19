## Title

Cases: 100; Steps: 60 
Spread Distance: 0.20
75% Asymptomatic Carrier
10% Case Fatality Rate

- include shiny sliders for values
- create animated chart to track number of cases
- maybe make people die after 10-15 steps of infection
- how to simulate R infection rate?
- how to include simulated social distancing?

scenario: in an office, go into work sick vs stay home

## Plot

```{r plot, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
data <- 
  fx_generate_data(cases = 100, steps = 60, 
                   .distance = 0.20,
                   .p_carrier = 0.75,
                   .p_death = 0.10,
                   .duration = 12)

data %>% fx_plot_infection_spread()
```
